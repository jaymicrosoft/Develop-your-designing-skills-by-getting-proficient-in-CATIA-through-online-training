# Develop-your-designing-skills-by-getting-proficient-in-CATIA-through-online-training
Initially used for automotive and aerospace designing, the scope of CATIA software has increased and when it comes to engineering, it has enabled the rapid development of mechanical products. The increase in the application of CATIA in the industry has given rise to the increase in demand of CATIA designers and consequently for CATIA online training. This training empowers the learner to do digital prototyping, digital analysis and simulation to understand the quality and performance of product designs early in the product development phase. It also allows them to create 3D parts from 3D sketches along with offering solutions to shape design, style, surface workspace, and visualize shapes. These tasks done by CATIA Â® let the users create, modify, and support complicated shapes.
